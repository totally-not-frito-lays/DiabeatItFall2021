7. get collaborating!
   * make sure you edit only the files you know that nobody else is working on

8. pull changes
   * number one thing you can do to avoid merge conflicts is to remember to `pull` updates from the remote before working on your device
   * this ensures that the version you are working on is the latest version

9. push changes

## Troubleshooting merge conflicts
Besides just crying, you can also:
 * nuke all the changes you've made and restart your local github repo
  1. Accept that you just lost your updates
  2. Delete local repository/files
  3. Redownload the github repo from this site
  4. Make your edits again :P
 * manually handle the merge conflicts
  1. decide whether you want to keep local vs remote changes in your merge conflict
  2. ???
  3. profit
